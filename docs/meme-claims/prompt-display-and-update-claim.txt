Prompt for web: Display meme claim and optionally update it

Use the following generated API models (from OpenAPI) for the meme-claims flow. Do not hand-roll types; use these so they stay in sync with the backend.

For GET (display) and PATCH (update) of a single claim by drop_id:
- MemeClaim – use this as the type for the claim returned by GET /memes-minting/claims/{drop_id} and by PATCH /memes-minting/claims/{drop_id}. It includes: drop_id, meme_id, image_location, animation_location, metadata_location, arweave_synced_at, description, name, image, attributes, image_details, animation_url, animation_details (and any other fields present on the generated MemeClaim).
- MemeClaimUpdateRequest – use this as the type for the request body of PATCH /memes-minting/claims/{drop_id}. Send only the fields you want to update (partial update). Do not send arweave_synced_at; the API ignores it and always sets it to null on any PATCH.

Supporting types (if your codegen exposes them) for nested structures:
- MemeClaimAttribute, MemeClaimImageDetails, MemeClaimAnimationDetails (and variants like MemeClaimAnimationDetailsVideo, MemeClaimAnimationDetailsHtml) as needed for attributes, image_details, and animation_details.

Requirements:
- Display the full claim (all relevant fields). Show both the media URL(s) and the actual media: render the image and, if present, the animation (video or HTML) in the UI, not only the URL.
- Allow editing the claim (admin only): form or inline edit that sends a PATCH with MemeClaimUpdateRequest. When the user changes the image or animation URL, the backend will recompute image_details (and for animation, behaviour may vary); you only need to send the updated URL(s) and optional other fields.
- If the user replaces image or animation media, we will need upload-to-S3 (or equivalent) flow to obtain a new URL to put in image / animation_url; keep that in mind for a follow-up (upload media, get URL, then PATCH with the new URL). For now, focus on display and PATCH with existing or manually entered URLs.
- Auth: only distribution admins can access GET and PATCH; ensure the UI is behind the same auth and that 403 is handled.

Scope: claims only. Do not implement merkles or proofs in this task.
