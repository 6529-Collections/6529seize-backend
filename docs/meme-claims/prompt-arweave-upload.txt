Prompt for web: Arweave upload with error handling and sync logic

Use the generated API model MemeClaim for the response of POST /memes-minting/claims/{drop_id}/arweave-upload. The response is the updated claim (same shape as GET claim), including arweave_synced_at.

Sync logic (important for when to show / enable the Arweave upload button):
- “Synced” means the claim has already been uploaded to Arweave: arweave_synced_at is non-null (timestamp in ms).
- “Not synced” means arweave_synced_at is null: either never uploaded or the claim was edited after the last upload (any PATCH sets arweave_synced_at back to null on the server).
- Only when the claim is not synced should the “Upload to Arweave” (or equivalent) button be enabled. If arweave_synced_at is set, the button should be disabled (or hidden), and optionally show a label like “Synced to Arweave” so the user understands why.
- If the user tries to upload when already synced, the API returns 409 Conflict; handle that in the UI (e.g. message “Already synced to Arweave”) and keep the button disabled when synced.

Error handling for POST /memes-minting/claims/{drop_id}/arweave-upload:
- 400 Bad Request – claim has no image URL. Show a clear message: the user must set an image (e.g. via PATCH or via media upload that sets image URL) before they can upload to Arweave.
- 403 Forbidden – not a distribution admin. Show an access-denied message.
- 404 Not Found – no claim for that drop_id. Navigate or show “Claim not found”.
- 409 Conflict – claim already synced. See above; keep upload button disabled when synced to avoid this.
- 500 – server error during fetch/upload. Show a generic retry-friendly error message.

After a successful upload, the API returns the updated MemeClaim with arweave_synced_at set and image_location, animation_location, metadata_location set to Arweave tx IDs (or the direct URL for HTML animation). Refresh or update local state so the UI shows “Synced” and disables the upload button.

Media in the UI:
- Do not show only URLs. Show both the URL and the actual media: render the image and, if present, the animation (video or HTML) so the user can see what will be uploaded.
- When the user replaces image or animation, we will need upload-to-S3 (or equivalent) to get a new URL before PATCHing the claim; that new URL is then used for the next Arweave upload. Plan for that flow (upload new media → get URL → PATCH claim with new image / animation_url → then user can trigger Arweave upload again if not synced).

Scope: claims and Arweave upload only. Do not implement merkles or proofs in this task.
