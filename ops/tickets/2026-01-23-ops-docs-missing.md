# Missing ops documentation

## Context
Required files `ops/readme.md` and `ops/tickets/README.md` were missing, blocking the agent workflow.

## Impact
Agent runs must halt until the required docs exist.

## Proposed fix
- Add minimal placeholders now to unblock.
- Follow up with owners to document the intended ops processes and ticket workflow.

## Owner
Unassigned.
